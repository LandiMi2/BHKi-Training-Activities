The Bioinformatics Hub of Kenya Intiative ([BHKi](https://bhki.org/)) is organizing a three day hybrid (in-person and virtual) seminar series event, scheduled in **July 19-20 2022**. 

### BHKi Seminars: Bioinformatics, software engineering and Data Management

The goal of this seminar series  is to create an opportunity to expose or introduce our community to open science, bioinformatics, soft skills and software research. The event will enhance networking and collaboration among our diverse community and other communities. Our target audience is bioinfromatics students and researchers who are working on their projects and need exposure to bioinformatics, open science and software research skills. 

Below is a three-day program of the hybrid event.

**Day 1 : Project Planning, Data Managment and softskills**

**Day 2 : Omics - Genomics, Proteomics, Transcriptomics and metabolomics.**
<br/>
The goal of Day 2 is to introduce participants to four main omic field namely: genomic, proteomics, transcriptomics and metabolomics in accordance to participants interest through seminars and open dialogues.<br/>
Afternoon sessions: All participants will be grouped into four groups - genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics with the goal of networkiing. Each participant in the group will introduce themselves and discuss trends in the fields in terms of methods, software, etc. Discuss emerging techniques and exciting developments.

**Research software - August (Dates to be confirmed soon)**
<br/>
We plan to have this seminar series on a different date because our target audiences are researchers and students in software research engineering. This seminar will expose our community to research software engineering skills and create a room for collaborations with skilled research software individuals/groups. In the end, grow existing research software engineers within our community and expand their networks.
