The Bioinformatics Hub of Kenya Intiative ([BHKi](https://bhki.org/)) is organizing a three day hybrid (in-person and virtual) seminar series event, scheduled in **June 14 - 16 2022**. 

### BHKi Seminars: Bioinformatics, software engineering and Data Management

The goal of this seminar series  is to create an opportunity to expose or introduce our community to open science, bioinformatics and software research. The event will enhance networking and collaboration among our diverse community and other communities. Our target audience is bioinfromatics students and researchers who are working on their projects and need exposure to bioinformatics, open science and software research skills. 

Below is a three-day program of the hybrid event.

**Day 1 :** Project Planning and Data Managment
The goal of Day 1 will comprise of talks about project planning, with a look into coming up with a project plan from conceptualization, analysis, communication and data management.
The afternoon practical sessions will introduce available open source project planning tools (or templates) e.g. Github projects, and agile. This will be followed by data management methods and a practical session on available tools for data management.

**Day 2 :**  Omics - Genomics, Proteomics, Transcriptomics and metabolomics. 
The goal of Day 2 is to introduce participants to four main omic field namely: genomic, proteomics, transcriptomics and metabolomics in accordance to participants interest through seminars and open dialogues. 
Afternoon sessions: All participants will be introduced to reporting scientific findings - how to write a manuscript and publishing in open journals, communicating your science through presentation - talks, poster presentations, speed talks etc
